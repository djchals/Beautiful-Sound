INTRODUCTION

Beautiful Sound is the author's exploratory DSP project. The goal is
to implement tools for creating visually pleasing images of sound and
music.

All tools read and write stereo WAVE input. If you need to use other
formats, there's a number of tools that will transcode your files
to/from WAVE, such as the excellent mpg123.



BUILDING

Before building Beautiful Sound, make sure you have the required
dependencies. These are:

    - g++ 4.6.1
    - libsndfile-dev
    - libfftw3-dev
    - libpng-dev

Once you've verified that you have the prerequisites, build Beautiful
Sound by calling make:

    $ make

The binaries will be placed in the 'bin' directory.
